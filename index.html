It's my pleasure to introduce my self well, I am BANGLADESH born in Bagerhat at Khulna. 
I am reading undergraduate program Computer science and engineering.</p>

  <h1>Computer science Related information:</h1>
  <p>Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) is an academic program at some universities that integrates the fields of computer engineering and computer science, providing knowledge of computing systems in both hardware and software design. The study program is modeled on German technical universities, where CS, CE and IT are treated as respectively the theoretical, technical and practical part of one field called "Informatik".

Courses include computer architecture, processor design, operating systems,
 computer networks, parallel processing, embedded systems, circuit analysis,
 analog and digital electronics, computer graphics, cloud, web and mobile computing,
 software engineering, database systems, digital signal processing, virtualization,
 computer simulations and games programming. 
 CSE programs also include core subjects of theoretical computer science such as theory of computation,
 design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, numerical analysis, machine learning,
 information theory, programming language theory and paradigms.
 The program aims at designing, developing and troubleshooting computing devices and systems 
 (such as personal computers, supercomputers, robots, smartphones, networking devices, embedded devices),
 focusing the underlying fundamental issues (like processor architecture design, operating system design,
 memory management, digital system design, communication protocol design, system software development,
 application software development, database management, high-performance and scientific computing) in the most efficient and effective way. 
 Emerging computing technologies like image processing, artificial intelligence, deep learning and data science are also covered under these programs.
 Most of the above CSE areas require initial mathematical knowledge, hence the first year of study is dominated by mathematical courses,
 primarily discrete mathematics, mathematical analysis, linear algebra, probability theory and statistics,
 as well as the basics of physics - field theory and electromagnetism.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish
	  a specific computing result. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms'
	  accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language
	  (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages 
	  that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central
	  processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance 
	  of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem.
	  The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
	  specialized algorithms, and formal logic..</p>

      <p class="card-text">We may be able to have a hundred or a thousand friends, or even more.
	  But there is only one friend who really has loyalty on you if you really think about it,
	  that is best friend. My best friend is my best partner for living my life. 
	  His name is Sugeng Gunawan, and I used to call him Sugeng. He is someone who really knows me deeply.
	  He knows the characteristic of me, from the outside and even inside of me. Someone who is able to feel my mood. 
	  He knows when I feel happy and when I feel very sad. He is also sad when I look sad, and he is also happy when I feel happy.
	  Someone who knows how to respond any kind of my mood, he knows how to comfort me. Someone who is always there for me.
	  He is there when I am happy and he is also there when I feel facing failure.  Someone who is able to understand me the most.
	  There is no relative between us, but there are many similarities in our characteristics. He is like myself and I am also like himself.
	  The similar characteristics have given an ease for us to be able to understand each other.
	  He is someone who is faithful and always taking care of me. He is a nice person, a friend who is able to share each other,
	  in joy and sorrow. Someone who is always there and always supporting me for reaching what I want.
	  Someone who is able to make me feel comfort if I take life with him and feel easy to fight any kind of life problems.
	  But it is different if I am alone without him, everything seems too difficult to fight.
	  He is my best friend, someone who is able to balance my life. As if he was someone who had been sent by God for completing my life to live..</p>

      <p class="card-text">Bangladesh, country of South Asia, located in the delta of the Padma (Ganges [Ganga]) and Jamuna (Brahmaputra) 
	  rivers in the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent.The riverine country of Bangladesh (“Land of the Bengals”) 
	  is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and its people are predominantly Muslim.
	  As the eastern portion of the historical region of Bengal, the area once formed, 
	  along with what is now the Indian state of West Bengal, the province of Bengal in British India.
	  With the partition of India in 1947, it became the Pakistani province of East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan),
	  one of five provinces of Pakistan, separated from the other four by 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of Indian territory. 
	  In 1971 it became the independent country of Bangladesh, with its capital at Dhaka.</p>
